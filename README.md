CIPHtool is a batch multitool i made when i was beginning with batch. it has a nice-ish menu, secret features, and like stupid features.

##  features

- main menu with pipes and colors
- secret menu (unlockable with a password)
- random color generator (epilepsy)
- matrix mode (cause why not)
- system uptime viewer
- fake "time travel" (i don't think it works)

##  how to run it

just download the `.bat` file and double-click it. thatâ€™s it. 
works on any `win` machine with `cmd `.

if you're

, you can `cd` into the `dir`ectory of the bat file and do:

```bat
CIPHtool
