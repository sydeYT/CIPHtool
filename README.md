# 🛠️ CIPHtool

> my old batch tool from way back. retro vibes, secret menus, and random cool stuff.

CIPHtool is a multitool i made for fun. built completely in batch, no fancies. just .bat. it has a nice-looking menu, secret features, and a bit of that fake hacker flair.

---

##  features

- main menu with pipes and colors
- secret menu (unlockable with a password)
- random color generator
- matrix mode (cause why not)
- system uptime viewer
- fake "time travel" script for the funnies (i don't think it works)

---

##  how to run it

just download the `.bat` file and double-click it. that’s it.  
works on any Windows machine with CMD.

```bat
CIPHtool.bat
